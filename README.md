# APIC-Demo

## Overview

Please refer to the README's provided in the directories titled "imperative" and "declarative" for further information.

We simply configured this repository against a Jenkins Pipeline to execute the script titled "script.sh" as defined in the imperative directory.

The variables defined in the script (prefixed with the $ symbol) were made known within the Jenkins scope by means of environment variables and global secrets

## Note
